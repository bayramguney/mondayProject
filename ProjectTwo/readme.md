# Java Project 2: States
This project about creating methods, arrayList and loops

##### TODO:
* After cloning this project don't forget to import junit4, how:
    * Navigate to **CountriesTest.java**, mouse over red lines and import **junit4**
* Even after you add junit you'll have red under **CountriesTest.java** and it is ok, 
because you did not implemented methods yet
* Navigate to **Countries.java** and start solving tasks, in some tasks you have to create methods 
and make sure that method name is exactly same as it is asked in task description, for example in first task:
    * method name must be *smallestNumber*
    * it must have *three int parameters*(parameter names is not important, but make it understandable)
    * should *return int*
* After creating method(in each task), test will run, but before that you'll not able to run any test
* After making all test green, it means all test passed successfully, push your code to your **github** repo
